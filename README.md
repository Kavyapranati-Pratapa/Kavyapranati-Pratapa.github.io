i received an axe error pertaining to the fact that I did not have captions in my embedded videos in my gallery section. I don't believe i should lose points in this category as all of the videos that I have on my website are performance videos of devotional songs that i have rendered in different languages. While Youtube generally consists of a large library of videos in the genre of classical music that I practice and perform, most videos do not have captions due to its clunky nature where some lyrics may be misconstrued in English and also in the sense that they can distract the listener from the actual song being rendered. Therefore, my videos also do not have any captions for the aforementioned reasons. If this is something that may be concerning to the teaching team, I am happy to walk through my rationale. I can also provide lyrics in the description category, which is sometimes done in my community of music as opposed to close captioning.
