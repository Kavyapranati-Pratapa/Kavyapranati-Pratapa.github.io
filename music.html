        <p class = "home_text">I began my journey in South Indian Classical Arts when I was 5 years old. I received my initial vocal training from 
        Smt. Vijayalakshmi Janakiraman, a disciple of several doyens of Carnatic music, including Vidwan Sri A.S. Panchapakesa Iyer and Vidwan Sri Maharajapuram Santhanam. In the nearly 14 years I spent
        under my teacher's guidance, I was not only taught the importance of practice, but was also exposed to the purity and sanctity of Carnatic music, which I seek to uphold and preserve as both a student and aspiring performer.</p>
        &nbsp;
        
        <p  class = "home_text">After completing my debut vocal concert ('arangetram') under Smt. Vijayalakshmi's guidance in 2017, I have been pursuing my advanced training under the able guidance of 'Isai Peroli' Vid. S Mahathi and Vid. Suma Venkatesh, a senior disciple of Sangita Kala Acharya Vid. Neela Ramgopal.
        Through music, I have had the opportunity to perform live in-person and virtual concerts for several reputed organizations and temples in the United States and India, including the SV Temple of Novi, MI, Thiagaraja Fine Arts Academy, Gayatri Fine Arts, California SR Fine Arts, Vijayanagar Fine Arts in Hyderabad, India, and Mani Krishnaswami Academy.</p>

      &nbsp;
        <p class = "home_text">I was featured on iCarnatic's Celebration Series in 2016 and was recently awarded the prestigious Indian Raga Fellowship in 2020, where I had the opportunity to collaborate with talented musicians across the world to further explore carnatic music in a 'new-age' manner. I was also selected by the Sudhaarnava Academy for Musical Excellence in Chennai, India to 
        further hone my capabilities as a musician under the guidance of Sangita Kalanidhi Smt. Sudha Ragunathan.</p>
      &nbsp;
          <p  class = "home_text">Beyond my vocal training, I am also trained in western and carnatic violin and am presently under the guidance of Kalaimamani Dr. M Narmadha.</p>
